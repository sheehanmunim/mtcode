# Deploy the Munim-owned T3 Connect relay through the repo's Alchemy stack
# (infra/relay/). Configuration and secrets come from ~/.mt/munim-relay.env
# (template: scripts/personal-munim-relay.env.example) — the Alchemy
# equivalent of `wrangler secret put`; nothing secret is checked in.
#
# A plain `wrangler deploy` cannot reproduce this Worker: the stack also
# provisions Cloudflare Queues, Hyperdrive over a PlanetScale Postgres
# cluster, Axiom datasets/tokens, per-environment cloudflared tunnels, DNS
# records, a cron trigger, and the Worker's custom domain, and the Worker will
# not boot without those bindings. Hence this wrapper around
# infra/relay/scripts/deploy.ts.
#
# On success, Alchemy writes the deployed relay URL into this repo's root
# .env; export it as T3CODE_RELAY_URL when building so client
# builds pick it up.
#
# Refuses unless FORCE_PAID_RELAY=1 — this stack is optional and billed.
