## Introduction

MT Code is a free, open-source desktop app for running and controlling coding agents — Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Grok Build, OpenCode, and Google Antigravity — from one place. It is [Munim Technologies](https://munimtech.com)' fork of [T3 Code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code) with extra features and fixes, and anyone can download and use it.

## Download

**[munimtech.com/mt-code](https://munimtech.com/mt-code)** — or grab installers straight from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/munimtechnologies/mtcode/releases):

- **macOS** (Apple Silicon): `MT-Code-<version>-arm64.dmg`
- **Windows** (x64): `MT-Code-<version>-x64.exe`

macOS builds are signed with a Developer ID but not yet notarized; Windows builds are unsigned:

- macOS: if Gatekeeper warns, right-click the app → **Open** (first launch only).
- Windows: if SmartScreen warns, choose **More info → Run anyway**.

The app auto-updates from this repository, so you get new MT Code features and fixes as they ship.

### Use it from a browser or phone

MT Code has no hosted web app of its own. Run the desktop app (or `npx t3@latest`) on your machine and reach it from another device over T3 Connect or your own HTTPS tunnel (Tailscale Serve works well); see [remote access](./docs/user/remote-access.md).

## Before you start

MT Code drives agents you already have. Install and sign in to at least one provider CLI:

- Claude: install [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) and run `claude`
- Codex: install [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) and run `codex login`
- Cursor: install [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/cli) and run `agent login`
- Grok Build: install [Grok Build CLI](https://x.ai/cli) and run `grok login`
- OpenCode: install [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) and run `opencode auth login`
- Antigravity: enable it in Settings, then use **Install Antigravity** and **Sign in with Google**. No CLI is required.

Your existing subscriptions are used directly — MT Code sells nothing and adds no accounts of its own.

Same cost model as T3 Code: the app and its server run on your computer, and model tokens come from Claude / Codex / Cursor / Grok / OpenCode. Munim hosts nothing on your behalf — pairing and Computer Use reach your machine directly. There is no Munim-hosted web app, no model proxy, no Workers AI classifier, and no PlanetScale relay unless you explicitly opt into that paid stack.

## MT Code vs T3 Code

Compared to [T3 Code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code). MT Code started as a fork. Upstream is merged only when you ask an agent to do it — nothing pulls `pingdotgg/t3code` automatically. Some rows started as unmerged upstream PRs that MT Code ships today; others were built here.

This table lists only the differences. Once T3 Code ships a feature MT Code had first, MT Code adopts T3 Code's implementation and the row leaves the table — drag-to-reorder, PDF attachments, cookie import, tool-activity grouping, composer drawers, preview viewport, file-chip reveal, macOS editor discovery and pull request stacks all went that way. Nothing T3 Code ships is missing here.

## Relationship to upstream

MT Code does not auto-merge [pingdotgg/t3code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code). Upstream lands only when you explicitly ask an agent to merge it. Features built here are offered upstream as PRs when they fit; some MT Code features started as unmerged upstream PRs we adopted. Bug reports about MT Code builds belong on [this repo's issues](https://github.com/munimtechnologies/mtcode/issues) — please don't file MT Code problems upstream.

MT Code exists because T3 Code is truly open. Credit and thanks to the T3 team.
