// Re-project the activity payloads already stored in projection_thread_activities.
//
// The projector used to write the provider's whole payload into the read model,
// while both transports projected it on the way out — so a database accumulated
// file-change patches and tool output no client was ever sent. The projector now
// stores the projected form; this rewrites the rows written before that.
//
// Nothing is deleted. `projection_thread_activities` is derived state, the
// projection is idempotent, and `orchestration_events` still holds every
// original payload, so a rebuild can reproduce anything dropped here.
//
// Stop the server first, then:
//   node apps/server/scripts/compact-activity-payloads.ts --base-dir ~/.mt
//   node apps/server/scripts/compact-activity-payloads.ts --base-dir ~/.mt --apply
//
// Without --apply it only reports what it would reclaim.
