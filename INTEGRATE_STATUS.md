## Required PR numbers (all present)

5920, 5806, 7308, 7309, 5213, 5821, 4630, 7226, 7267, 7152, 7150, 7240, 6516, 7160

## Key conflict resolutions

### Tier 2 usage (`usage.ts`, `UsagePage.tsx`)

- Took tier2 `usageEnvironmentScope` implementation; resolved duplicate import in `UsagePage.tsx`.

### Tier 3 + Tier 4 preview (desktop)

- Kept **both** `setViewport` (tier3) and `setAudioMuted` (tier4) across ipc/preload/contracts/Manager.

### Tier 4-big2 (goals + queued turns + beta settings)

- Migration **041** = `ProjectionThreadsGoal`, **042** = `ProjectionThreadTurnQueue`.
- `ProjectionSnapshotQuery` thread rows: `goal` + `hasQueuedTurns`.
- `ProviderRequestKind` includes `tool` + `permissions`.
- `ChatView` / mobile composer: goals **and** queued-turn delivery modes.
- Voice dictation linked to `/settings/beta`; orphaned route cleaned in `ec545fb58`.

## Remaining / optional

- Fork tier branches (`tier1`–`tier4-*`) are all **0 commits ahead** of `personal-integrate`.
- Re-fetch `fork` periodically for new tier branches; none pending at last check.
